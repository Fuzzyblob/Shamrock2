# HTML5 Boilerplate for Node, Express, and Jade

  Striving for feature-parity with [HTML5 Boilerplate](http://html5boilerplate.com); nothing more, nothing less.

  Built using [node](http://nodejs.org), the [Express](http://expressjs.org) framework, and its default templating 
  language [Jade](http://jade-lang.com)
  
## Usage

  All you need to do is clone this existing project, naming the remote something other than origin so you can
  still use that name for your own remote repo.
  
    git clone -o h5bp git://github.com/aoberoi/h5bp-express-jade.git my-project
  
  Now cd into your project directory and install dependencies with npm
  
    cd my-project
    npm install
  
  Make sure you change the default info inside package.json to reflect your project's info, specifically the
  "name" value. You can now start the app using the following:
  
    node app.js
